# Nara

Nara is my customized version of the [Kohi Game Engine](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi), following (mostly) along with the YouTube series and tweaking things as I see fit to match my own style and opinions.

Like Travis, the repository is named after a Japanese word, 倣う (read: narau), meaning "to imitate", or "to copy". I thought that was fitting for a recreation of his engine.
